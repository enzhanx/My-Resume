<h1>More About Me</h1>
<p>Born on May 16, 1992, I stand at a height of 5'10" and maintain a weight of 72 kgs. As a proud Filipino citizen, my faith in the Roman Catholic tradition grounds me in values and principles. I am happily married with an only child, while my wife works in Canada. Beyond my professional life as a Front-End Developer, my passions include playing computer and mobile games online, creating rhythms on the drums, and cherishing the company of friends. These hobbies fuel my creativity and provide a balanced perspective on life, allowing me to connect with people and enjoy the journey every step of the way.</p>
